# workout how to save a url embedding, pickle? -> fast to write to, slow to read, easy to store in a db.
#   tojson() ?

# Find each different path / query category in the tree automatically, using regex patterns? / tree depth etc when traversing the tree. 
#   Start by taking a simple printout of a tree with muytlipe url types from a unit test.

# For each url TEXT Path in the url embedding, categroise the category of urls by checking the rankpair for 
#   that subtree (ensure can calculate rankpair of subtreenodes too w/ tests).
